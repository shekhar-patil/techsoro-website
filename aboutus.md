My name Shekhar Patil I am Ruby on Rails developer, swimmer, and technical blog writer from Pune.

Currently, I am the solo blog writer at techSoro and I am building a team of developers to develop mini projects and to organize workshops for website development.

It will be a great experience to work together and build something good. If you are interested then contact me at patilshekhar900@gmail.com
